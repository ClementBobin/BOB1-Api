# Bob1 API: modular monolith (.NET 10)

One ASP.NET Core API, one PostgreSQL database (one set of tables per module), strict module boundaries.

## Run
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef    # once

# PostgreSQL for development (matches the connection string in appsettings.json)
docker run -d --name bob1-pg -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_DB=bob1 -e POSTGRES_USER=bob1 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=bob1 postgres:17-alpine

# Create the first migration of every module (bash / PowerShell)
./scripts/migrations.sh Initial
./scripts/migrations.ps1 Initial

dotnet run --project src/Bob1.Api         # Development: applies migrations, seeds data, listens on :5000
```
The database is PostgreSQL. The connection string is `ConnectionStrings:Default`
(default: `Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=bob1;Username=bob1;Password=bob1`); in production set it through
`ConnectionStrings__Default`. `docker-compose.yml` starts the API together with a Postgres 17 container
(set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env`).

Dev accounts: `parent@bob1.local / Parent123!`, `staff@bob1.local / Staff123!`, `admin@bob1.local / Admin123!`.
Try the API with `requests.http` (VS Code REST Client / Rider / Visual Studio). OpenAPI: `/openapi/v1.json`.

Changed an entity? `./scripts/migrations.sh <Name>`. Early on, the simplest reset is:
drop and recreate the `bob1` database, delete every module's `Infrastructure/Migrations/` folder, recreate `Initial`.

## Seasons

A season runs 1 Sept → 31 Aug (label `2026-2027`); the current one is derived from today's date and its row is created automatically (Club `seasons` table).
- `Membership(UserId, Season, DivisionId)` replaces `User.DivisionId`; a new season starts as a copy of the previous one, edits only touch the current season.
- Matches carry a stored `Season` and must fall in the current season; matches and manual points of past seasons are read-only.
- `QUERY /seasons`, `QUERY /admin/seasons/overview`, `season` filter on matches / people / rankings / points-history, `QUERY /admin/people/{id}/memberships` (Parcours).
- Schema of Club, Identity and Matches changed.

## Solution layout

    ├── <Name>Module.cs          # DI registration, migrations + dev seed

```
Modules never reference each other. They talk through `Bob1.Shared/Contracts/<Module>` (interface + DTOs, resolved by DI
at runtime) or domain events. Each module owns one DbContext, its own `__EFMigrationsHistory_<Module>` table, and never
queries another module's tables (isolation is by DbContext and table ownership, all in the same database).

```
| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| Club | divisions, teams, venues |
| Identity | users (parents and children share the table; a child user has a `divisionId`), families, JWT + refresh tokens, family invitations |
| Matches | calendar, match admin (home/away teams), cancel, mark played |
| Carpool | rides, bookings (seat contention handled with an optimistic concurrency token) |
| Participation | presence confirmation, volunteer/staff slots, commitments, J-4 reminder job |
| Notifications | FCM device tokens, in-app notification list, push (Firebase), admin broadcast |
| Ranking | points ledger, scoring rules, leaderboard, penalties |

Rules: a module exposes only its `*Module` class; everything else is `internal`. What other modules may use lives in `Bob1.Shared/Contracts/<Module>`.
HTTP endpoints are MVC controllers (`Features/*Controller.cs`, deriving from `ApiControllerBase`). They stay `internal` too:
`AddModuleControllers` (SharedKernel) registers each module assembly and a feature provider that accepts internal controllers.
Modules never touch each other's tables: they call `Public` interfaces or react to domain events
(`PresenceConfirmed`, `SlotJoined/Left`, `RideOffered/Cancelled`, `MatchCancelled`).

## Endpoints (`/api/v1`)
**Auth**: `POST /auth/register | login | refresh | logout`
**Me**: `GET/PUT /me`, `PUT /me/password`, `POST/DELETE /me/push-tokens`, `QUERY /me/commitments`
**Family** (Parent): `GET /family` (members, children included), `POST /family/invitations`
**Club**: `QUERY /divisions | /teams | /venues` (body: `search`, `isActive`, `divisionId`, `skip`, `take`)
**List endpoints use the HTTP `QUERY` method** (safe + idempotent, criteria in a JSON body). Paginated ones answer `{ "total": n, "items": [...] }`; send `skip`/`take`.

**Matches**: `QUERY /matches` (body: `divisionId`, `memberId`, `from`, `to`, `status`, `search`, `skip`, `take`), `GET /matches/{id}`, `GET /matches/{id}/participation`
**Participation** (Parent): `POST /matches/{id}/presence/confirm`; any role: `POST/DELETE /slots/{id}/join`
**Carpool**: `QUERY/POST /matches/{id}/rides`, `PUT/DELETE /rides/{id}`, `POST/DELETE /rides/{id}/booking`
**Staff**: `QUERY /staff/open-slots`, `QUERY /staff/assignments`
**Ranking**: `QUERY /rankings` (body: `category`, `season`, `view`, `search`, `skip`, `take`), `QUERY /rankings/me/entries`, `QUERY /ranking-rules`
**Notifications**: `QUERY /notifications`, `GET /notifications/unread-count`, `POST /notifications/{id}/read`, `POST /notifications/read-all`
**Admin**: `/admin/people` (list, roles, active), `/admin/divisions | teams | venues` (CRUD), `/admin/matches` (create, update, cancel, played),
`/admin/matches/{id}/slots` + `/admin/slots/{id}` + `/admin/slots/urgent`, `/admin/matches/{id}/participation` (roster),
`/admin/ranking-rules/{key}`, `/admin/rankings`, `/admin/penalties` (+ `/quick`; there is no penalty category: negative points in a regular category), `/admin/points-history`, `PUT /admin/points/{id}` and `POST /admin/points/{id}/revoke` (manual rows only), `/admin/notifications` (broadcast)

Errors are ProblemDetails with a stable `code` (e.g. `slot.full`, `ride.full`, `match.already_started`, `auth.invalid_credentials`).

## Push notifications (Firebase)
Set `Firebase:CredentialsPath` to your service-account JSON. Without it, pushes are only logged.
The mobile app registers its FCM token with `POST /me/push-tokens`.

## Not done yet (TODO)
- 2FA (TOTP), password reset by email
- Refuse deleting divisions/venues/teams still referenced by users/matches
- Notify on match rescheduling; carpool/slot reminders for admins
- Tests: architecture tests (NetArchTest) for the module boundaries, Testcontainers integration tests
- Rate limiting on `/auth/*`, CORS if you add a web admin

## PostgreSQL notes

- Provider: `Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`. The old SQLite migrations were removed: every module's `Initial` migration must be regenerated (`./scripts/migrations.sh Initial`) against this provider.
- Unique-constraint races are detected with SQLSTATE `23505` (`DbErrors.IsUniqueViolation`).
- Text search uses `ILIKE` (Postgres `LIKE` is case-sensitive).
- `Npgsql.EnableLegacyTimestampBehavior` is on (see `Program.cs`): dates are `timestamp without time zone`, holding UTC, exactly as with SQLite.
